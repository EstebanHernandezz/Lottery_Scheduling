## Description

This project is a lottery simulation. In this simulation, there are multiple processes created that are assigned a number of lottery tickets.
Through the scheduler class, the process set to run is randomly selected based on the total number of tickets in the corresponding process. Using the randome module, a random number is generated in the span of 1 and the total number of tickets. After iterating through all processes, when the current ticket count is equal to or greater than the randomly generated number - the process containing the count that satisfied "equal to or greater than" is chosen as the winner.
